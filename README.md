Learn how to use Google to research problems and find solutions.
Apply problem-solving skills to identify and address challenges in the project.
Communicate effectively with stakeholders to ensure that the dashboard meets their needs.


## Project Flow

* Gather and transform attendance data from a variety of sources.
* Create metrics to track employee attendance, such as the number of days absent, the average number of days absent per month, the reasons for absences, working preferences, and sick leave percentage.
* Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes the attendance data in a clear and easy-to-understand way. The dashboard should include charts and graphs that show the following:
    * Trends in employee attendance over time.
    * Patterns in employee absences, such as which days of the week or months of the year employees are most likely to be absent.
    * Working preferences of employees, such as how often they work from home and why.
    * Sick leave percentage and reasons for sick leave.
* Share the dashboard with managers and other stakeholders so that they can use it to track employee attendance, identify trends, and make informed decisions about employee scheduling and policies.
